Description of Dataset: 

Here is three datasets which include WOS-11967 , WOS-46985, and WOS-5736
Each folder contains:
-X.txt 
-Y.txt
-YL1.txt
-YL2.txt

X is input data that include text sequences 
Y is target value 
YL1 is target value of level one (parent label)
YL2 is target value of level one (child label)

Meta-data:
This folder contain on data file as following attribute:
Y1	Y2	Y	Domain	area	keywords	Abstract

Abstract is input data that include text sequences of  46,985 published paper
Y is target value 
YL1 is target value of level one (parent label)
YL2 is target value of level one (child label)
Domain is majaor domain which include 7 labales: {Computer  Science,Electrical  Engineering,  Psychology,  Mechanical  Engineering,Civil  Engineering,  Medical  Science,  biochemistry}
area is subdomain or area of the paper such as CS-> computer graphics which contain 134 labels.
keywords : is authors keyword of the papers
